KEYSIM TOOL
===========

The "KEYSIM" tool (Key Simulator tool) is keyboard based tool which can simulate keyboard events.

1) It can take a set of keystroke pattern in a configuration file and can simulate those keystrokes in the system.

2) If we want to do those steps repeatedly, we can set a start and stop limit.
 
3) Also it provides the ability of integrating excel files with tool so that the tool can use the values in the excel sheet.

4) There is no need of extra hardware or software requirements, but only latest version of java is required.

As of now, the tool doesn't have capabilities of taking decisions by its own according to situations. It can only simply imitate whatever strokes we have specified to do.

The tasks which are monotonous and using the same steps repeatedly whole time can be automated using the tool.
Few examples are exporting of components, importing of components, message code creations etc.

Even though the tool runs in the local machine environment, it can operate on any applications like CITRIX RECIEVER, since the tool is only simulating the actual keystrokes done by the user.


Tool Operation Basics
======================

1)  Specify the set of key strokes to be executed in the configuration file according to the syntax.

2)  Select the desired set of operation from the operation set.

3)  Load the component file if the operations specified uses components from the component file.

4) Give proper start and end limit for iteration.

5) Click on the window we want to do the operations and click run in the tool. The tool automatically goes to the previously
selected window before starting the operation set.

6) Use stop in the tool in case of any errors are occurring.

7) In case of any errors stop the tool and do a manual correction on the error and start the tool again with the updated start value for iteration.
